NBA shooting predictions

This project aims at analyzing basketball players shots (missed vs made) 
taking into account time, space and players characteristics.

Supervised classification models (Random Forest vs XG Boost) 
are used and compared to determine if one algorithm can predict shots results with a good accuracy.

Data_cleaning script was used to clean original datas and create an intermediate csv file (df_cleaned_shots.csv).
The original file IS NOT within this GitHub Project so one can directly use the EDA python file or ML python file.

RESULTS ARE PRESENTED IN THE WORD FILE and EDA analysis is available in a Jupyter script while ML algoriths are performed in a python file.
